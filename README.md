# 🧠 Coding Week – Machine Learning

This repository contains the solution to **Task 1** from the **Coding Week – Machine Learning** challenge. The objective was to build and evaluate a predictive model based on a provided dataset, following a standard machine learning workflow.

## 📌 Task Overview

The task involved understanding and modeling a dataset to predict binary outcomes. Although the final model underperformed compared to a simple baseline (always predicting "No"), the exercise demonstrates a full pipeline of data analysis and model interpretation.

## 🔍 Project Structure

The `Task1.ipynb` notebook follows this flow:

1. **Feature Hypothesis**  
   - Attempted to infer the nature and meaning of features in the absence of explicit metadata.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Developed a classification model using `scikit-learn` pipelines and standard techniques.
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy and comparison with a naive baseline.

4. **Model Interpretation**  
   - Applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand the impact of individual features on model predictions.
